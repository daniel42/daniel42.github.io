I go through these phases being a dilettante in subjects, 
usually related to something computing related. This last
two weeks I've been studying mechanical keyboards heavily. The
Internet is full of random communities with interest in 
all kind of things. 

I went into this thinking it would be awesome to build a 
custom keyboard. As a programmer, the keyboard is probably 
my most wielded physical tool. I had a Jedi Knight moment, 
thinking about keyboard building like the Jedi building
their lightsabers. 

With any random interest, there are people who
care about these details of keyboard building. The amount 
of Reddit posts and YouTube videos waxing poetic about
the subject. The sound of every keystroke; the feeling of 
the switch bottoming out; or the smoothness of the keypress.

It's been fun but like everything I dabble in, I'm starting
to lose interest though these things come in phases.
