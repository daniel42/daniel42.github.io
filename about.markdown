Playing around with creating a blog again and the tooling around it. I used
to blog more but it my last blog post was over a decade ago! We'll call that
a lost decade. As I get older, I do want to remember all the stuff I've done.
Part utility, part nostalgia but a large element of blogging back in the day
was reflecting on experiences and learning from it.
